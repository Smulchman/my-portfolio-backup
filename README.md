# portfolio-landing-page
The homework assignment for week 1

## Description

This project was designed to serve as a landing or home page for a personal portfolio. It includes a brief introduction to me, including a picture of me, and it includes a series of large pictures which can link users to other things I've created. It serves as an interactive resume of sorts.


## Installation

NA

## Usage

This website is intended to serve as a cursory introduction to me and I built it for personal use. Replacing the images with images of apps or other webpages and allowing a user to navigate to a dedicated page for each.
